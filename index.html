            <p>For the Freedom Project, I am making a website by using HTML, CSS, and Github.</p>
            <p>It’s all about how visual arts can create a connection with different fields of technology and share my experience during the process of doing the FP.</p>
            <p>In my freedom project blog entries, I recorded my thought process. Feel free to click this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oP9vSG388G0RjkSoutiM7QkBKvfK-1OaZgGT3TZ6Zgc/edit">link</a> to see it!</p>

            <h4 class="card-title" align="center"> Motivation </h4>
            <p>The reason I choose to do visual arts is because I am interested in learning how art and technology can be combined together and what impact will come out if they are connected. Technology is playing an important role in visual arts. It makes an illustrator's life simpler by providing tech tools like drawing apps and it also supports beginners to become more professionals. In conclusion, technology is helpful to visual artists to find a career and visual art itself. It opens a new door for arts and it’s being introduced to more people in the world through technology.</p>

            <p> Drawing is one of the oldest form of human expression</p>
            <p> "It is believed that drawing was used as a specialised form of communication before the invention of the written language, demonstrated by the production of cave and rock paintings around 30,000 years ago."  - Source from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing#:~:text=It%20is%20believed%20that%20drawing,Art%20of%20the%20Upper%20Paleolithic)">Wikipedia</a> </p>
            <p>In early days, people used sharp props to paint on stones. As our world became more advanced, we started to use pen, pencils, color pencils, watercolor, oil painting, etc.</p>

        <h1>How Tech Is Used in Visual Arts from the Past Until Now?</h1>     
        
        <p>There are many software and apps for drawing and manga digitally. It's easier than ever to get professional-level software as long as you have a device.<p>

                <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
